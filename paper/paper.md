# Summary

[Generalized linear models](GLMs) are
well-established tools for regression and classification, and are widely
applied across the sciences, economics, business, and finance. They are
especially useful because their loss functions are convex, meaning they are
easy and efficient to fit. Moreover, they are relatively easy to interpret
because their noise terms are well defined, and the non-linearities they contain
are point-wise.

Mathematically, a GLM is defined as follows:

$$\min_{\beta_0, \beta} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \mathcal{L} (y_i, \beta_0 + \beta^T x_i)
+ \lambda \mathcal{P}(\beta)$$

where $\mathcal{L} (y_i, \beta_0 + \beta^T x_i)$ is the negative log-likelihood of an
observation $x_i$, and $\lambda \mathcal{P}(\cdot)$ is the penalty that regularizes the solution,
with $\lambda$ being a constant that controls the amount of regularization.

Modern datasets can contain an enormous number of predictor variables, and
data analysis is often exploratory. Under these conditions it is critically
important to regularize the model to avoid overfitting the data.
Regularization works by adding penalty terms that penalize the model parameters in
a variety of different ways. This can be used to incorporate prior knowledge 
about the parameters in a structured form. In Pyglmnet, we offer
users the ability to combine different types of regularization with different noise
distributions in the GLMs.

Despite the attractiveness of regularized GLMs, the available tools in
the Python data science eco-system are highly fragmented. Specifically:

-  [statsmodels] provides a wide range of link functions but no regularization.
-  [scikit-learn] provides elastic net regularization but only limited noise distribution options.
-  [lightning] provides elastic net and group lasso regularization, but only for
   linear and logistic regression.

[Pyglmnet] is a response to this fragmentation. Here is a comparison of Pyglmnet with existing toolboxes.

Pyglmnet implements the same algorithm described in [Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2010)](https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6287975.pdf>) and the accompanying widely popular R package [glmnet].
As opposed to [glmnet-python], which is a wrapper around this package, Pyglmnet is written in pure Python and runs on Python 3.5+. The implementation is compatible with the existing data science ecosystem.
Pyglmnet's API is designed to be compatible with scikit-learn. Thus, it is possible to do::


```py
           glm.fit(X, y)
           glm.predict(X)
```

As a result of this compatibility, ``scikit-learn`` tools for building pipelines, cross-validation and grid search can be reused by Pyglmnet users. Pyglmnet has already been used in published work
[@bertran2018active; @rybakken2019decoding; @hofling2019probing; @benjamin2017modern]. It is unit tested and includes documentation in the form of tutorials, docstrings and
examples that are run through continuous integration.
